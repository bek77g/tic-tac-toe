## How to Play 🎯

1. When the game starts, you'll see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
2. Player 1 goes first, and each player takes turns by clicking on an empty cell to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled, and there's no winner, the game ends in a draw.
